# JavaScript-Reference

The JavaScript Reference is a set of chapters for the basics of the JS lenguage. Basically is a mix whit the main concepts I got from the series of books "You dont know javascript" and other info added myself.

"You dont know JS" series is one of the best books I have read to learn JS, but it is quite extensive when you needed to consult an information, so I created this guide for 2 reassons:

- Firt of all by doing so i could get all the main concpets of the JS lenaguage clear.
- Secondly, to have a quick reference guide of the main concepts of the JS lenguage, all resume in very shorts chapters with examples. This way i could quicly find my doubts and get all well structured in my head.

I hope this guide help you get all JS main concpets clear like it helped me!!!

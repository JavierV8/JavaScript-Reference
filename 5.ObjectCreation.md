JavaScript is a programming language based on prototypes and does not support classes, instead create object from another object and it can be doing it in 6 different ways.

# Object literal

Is the simplest way to create objects in JavaScript.

```js
const counter = {
  state: function(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.count = 0;
  },
  add: function(number) {
    this.count += number;
  },
  remove: function(number) {
    this.count -= number;
  },
  checkCount: function() {
    return this.count;
  },
  getName: function() {
    return this.name;
  }
};

counter.state("George");
console.log(counter.getName()); //George
counter.add(2);
console.log(counter.checkCount()); //2
```

# Object.Create

Object.create() is a JavaScript method that allow to create a new object with the prototype set from other object.

```js
const counter = {
  state: function (name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.count = 0;
  },
  add: function (number) {
    this.count += number;
  },
  remove: function (number) {
    this.count -= number;
  },
  checkCount: function () {
    return this.count;
  },
  getName: function () {
    return this.name;
  }
};

const counter2 = Object.create(counter);
counter2.state("George");
console.log(counter2.getName()); //George
counter2.add(2);
console.log(counter2.checkCount()); //2
```

```js
var MyClass1 = function () {
  this.member1 = "m1";
};

MyClass1.prototype.function1 = function () {
  return "return from function1";
};

var instance1 = new MyClass1();
var instance2 = Object.create(MyClass1.prototype, {
  member2: {
    value: "m2",
    writable: true
  }
});

// instance1
console.log("instance1.member1: " + instance1.member1); //m1
console.log("instance1.function1: " + instance1.function1()); //return from function1
console.log("instance1.member2: " + instance1.member2); //undefined

// instance2
console.log("instance2.member1: " + instance2.member1); //undefined
console.log("instance2.member2: " + instance2.member2); //m2
console.log("instance2.function1: " + instance2.function1()); //return from function1
```

# Constructor Pattern

This pattern uses a constructor function, which is a normal JavaScript function that is called using the new keyword. By using the new keyword, we are telling JavaScript to execute the function and immediately will create a new object and return it. Also, it will set the context of "this" to the new object and any change made to the instances will only affect them and not the others. The main problem with the Constructor Pattern is, that methods are copied to all new object instances. This problem led to the creation of the Combination Prototype Pattern.

```js
function counter(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.count = 0;

  this.add = function(number) {
    this.count += number;
  };
  this.remove = function(number) {
    this.count -= number;
  };
  this.checkCount = function() {
    return this.count;
  };
  this.getName = function() {
    return this.name;
  };
}

const counter2 = new counter("George");
console.log(counter2.getName()); //George
```

# Prototypal Pattern

Create objects in the same way Constructor pattern does, but methods of the object are created by using prototypal delegation, so all instances objects will point to the same methods instead of creating their own individual copies. This way avoids to replicate the methods in all instances making the code more efficient.

```js
function counter(name) {
  this.name = name;
  this.count = 0;
}
counter.prototype = {
  add: function(number) {
    return (this.count += number);
  },
  checkCount: function() {
    return this.count;
  },
  getName: function() {
    return this.name;
  }
};

const counter2 = new counter("George");
console.log(counter2.getName()); //George
```

# ES6 Classes

With the arrival of ES6, classes were introduced, another way to create objects. But it is just a syntactic sugar, JavaScript is dynamic and does not provide a class implementation, Under the hood JavaScript classes remains on prototype delegation. So, this syntax was introduces to make the code more simpler and understandable.

```js
class counter {
  constructor(name) {
    this.name = name;
    this.count = 0;
  }
  add = function(number) {
    this.count += number;
  };
  remove = function(number) {
    this.count -= number;
  };
  checkCount = function() {
    return this.count;
  };
  getName = function() {
    return this.name;
  };
}

const counter2 = new counter("George");
console.log(counter2.getName()); //George
counter2.add(2);
console.log(counter2.checkCount()); //2
```

# Factory Functions

In JavaScript, any function can create an object. When that function is not a constructor or class, is called factory function. they are simply functions that create objects, but thanks to the advantage of closures, offer the ability to produce easily instances of objects without immersing themselves in the complexities of classes. In JavaScript you can use factory instead of using classes, since they are basically more simple than classes and easier to reason.

```js
const counter = name => {
  let state = {
    name,
    count: 0
  };
  return {
    add: function(number) {
      state.count += number;
    },
    remove: function(number) {
      state.count -= number;
    },
    checkCount: function() {
      return state.count;
    },
    getName: function() {
      return state.name;
    }
  };
};

const counter2 = counter("George");
console.log(counter2.getName()); //George
counter2.add(2);
console.log(counter2.checkCount()); //2
```

## Advantages of Factory Functions

- The properties and methods of a class object are public, when factory is used functions only the methods we expose are public, everything else is encapsulated.
- In JavaScript the this keyword works differently and using classes you have the problem If you lose the context of this for example, this loses the context in nested functions. Not only is it annoying during coding, but it is also a constant source of mistakes.
- The keyword new must be used when creating objects using classes, but it is not necessary when creating objects with factory functions.

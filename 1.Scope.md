# 1. Scop

Scop is a well-defined set of rules for storing variables and that determines the visibility and accessibility of those variables in your code area.

## Global Scope

There's only one Global scope in the JavaScript document. The area outside all the functions is consider the global scope and the variables defined inside the global scope can be accessed and altered in any other part of the program.

```js
//global scope
var fruit = 'apple'
console.log(fruit);        //apple

function getFruit(){
    console.log(fruit);    //fruit is accessible here
}

getFruit();                //apple
```

## Local Scope

Variables declared inside the functions become Local to the function and are considered in the corresponding local scope. Every Functions has its own scope. Same variable can be used in different functions because they are bound to the respective functions and are not mutual visible.

```js
//global scope
function foo1(){
    //local scope 1
    function foo2(){
        //local scope 2
    }
}

//global scope
function foo3(){
    //local scope 3
}

//global scope
```

Local scope can be divided into function scope and block scope. The concept of block scope is introduced in ECMA script 6 (ES6) together with the new ways to declare variables -- const and let.


## Function Scope

Whenever you declare a variable in a function, the variable is visible only within the function. You can't access it outside the function. var is the keyword to define variable for a function-scope accessibility.

```js
function foo(){
    var fruit ='apple';
    console.log('inside function: ',fruit);
}

foo();                    //inside function: apple
console.log(fruit);       //error: fruit is not defined 
```

## Block Scope

A block scope is the area within if, switch conditions or for and while loops. Generally speaking, whenever you see {curly brackets}, it is a block. In ES6, const and let keywords allow developers to declare variables in the block scope, which means those variables exist only within the corresponding block.

```js
function foo(){
    if(true){
        var fruit1 = 'apple';        //exist in function scope
        const fruit2 = 'banana';     //exist in block scope
        let fruit3 = 'strawberry';   //exist in block scope

    }
    console.log(fruit1);
    console.log(fruit2);
    console.log(fruit3);
}

foo();
//result:
//apple
//error: fruit2 is not defined
//error: fruit3 is not defined
```

## Lexical Scope

The lexical scope means that the child scope has access to the variables defined in the parent scope. Child functions are lexically linked to the execution context of their parents. 
In other words, a variable defined outside of a function can be accessible inside another function defined after the variable declaration. But the opposite is not true; variables defined within a function will not be accessible outside of that function.

```js
function foo1(){
    var fruit1 = 'apple';        
    const fruit2 = 'banana';     
    let fruit3 = 'strawberry';
    function foo2(){
        console.log(fruit1);
        console.log(fruit2);
        console.log(fruit3);
    }
    foo2();
}

foo1();

//result:
//apple
//banana
//strawberry
```

# Hoisting

The JavaScript engine will compile your JavaScript code before it interprets it, and part of the compilation phase is finding and associating all declarations with their appropriate scopes, called "lexical scope".
"Hoisting" is JavaScript's default behavior of moving declarations to the top. that is, All of these variable and function declarations are "moved" from where they appear in the code flow to the top of the code, the functions being brought up first, then the variables. It is also important to note that the climb is by range.

# Closure

Closure is a mechanism by which an inner function will have access to the variables defined in its outer function’s lexical scope even after the outer function has returned.

Closure is when a function “remembers” its lexical scope even when the function is executed outside that lexical scope.

A Closure is a function within another function, which has access to the variables of the external function and returns the value of the internal function. We can use closures to create private variables and write a better code that isolates our logic and application, that is, to give privacy to the objects.

The closure only exists if the function returns an internal function that use variables of the external function, otherwise it will only be a nested function.

```js
function creaSumador(x) {
  return function(y) {
    return x + y;
  };
}
var suma5 = creaSumador(5);
var suma10 = creaSumador(10);
console.log(suma5(2)); // 7
console.log(suma10(2)); // 12

```

```js
function counter() {
  var _counter = 0;
  return {
    add: increment => {
      _counter += increment;
    },
    value: () => {
      console.log("el valor es " + _counter);
      return "The counter is currently at: " + _counter;
    }
  };
}
var c = counter();
c.add(5);
c.add(9);
// now we can access the private variable:
c.value(); // => The counter is currently at: 14
```

```js
function once(fn, thisArg) {
  var hasBeenCalled = false;
  return function() {
    if (!hasBeenCalled) {
      hasBeenCalled = true;
      return fn.apply(thisArg, arguments);
    }
  };
}

function add(a, b) {
  console.log(a + b);
}
function doMath(a, b, c) {
  console.log(this.firstName + " adds " + (a + b + c));
}

var addOnce = once(add, this);
addOnce(2, 2); // 4
addOnce(2, 2); // undefined
addOnce(2, 2); // undefined

var instructor = { firstName: "Elie" };
var doMathOnce = once(doMath, instructor);
doMathOnce(1, 2, 3); // "Elie adds 6"
doMathOnce(1, 2, 3); // undefined
```

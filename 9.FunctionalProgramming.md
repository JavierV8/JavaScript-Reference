## Functional Programing

Functional programming is a programming paradigm, which means it's a way of thinking about building software based on some principles. Other examples of programming paradigms include object-oriented programming and programming procedures.

Functional programming is the process of creating software by compose pure functions, which avoids the shared state, mutation of data and collateral effects. It is declarative rather than imperative, and application state flows through pure functions. Contrast with object-oriented programming, where the state of the application it is usually shared.

### Pure Functions

A pure function is a function that given the same inputs, always returns the same output and has no side effects, which it means that it cannot alter any external state. They are extremely independents - easy to move, refactor, and rearrange in your code, which makes its programs more flexible and adaptable to the future changes.

### Function Composition

Function composition is the process of combining two or more functions to produce a new function. So when it comes to creating objects, the compositing functions they are better than inheritance, and that's due to two common problems:

- Option 1 is known as the duplication problem of necessity. Since it is not as flexible as the composition of functions and when you want to modify the code in the end you end up duplicating methods.
- Option 2 is that you have a number of features that you do not use, all this implicit environment that they carry with them that you end up with the Gorilla / Banana problem: You wanted a banana, but what you got was a gorilla holding a banana and all the jungle with him.

It is with classical inheritance, that you build objects thinking about what things are, while with composition you build the objects thinking about what they do. Object Composition completely avoids the use of this. this keyword is confusing for many and does not behave in the same way as in other languages, so avoiding it helps in the understanding the code. I should point out here that avoiding this comes at a cost. Because Object.assign () copies the properties (including functions) from one object to another, you are increasing the load on the memory. When using prototypes Delegation and the this keyword do not duplicate the functions and properties, but they delegate. That is prototypical inheritance value, but that doesn't mean you have to emulate the classes. Method delegation can conserve memory resources because it only needs one copy of each method to be shared by all instances.

## Avoid Shared state

The shared state is any variable, object or memory space that is shared, As in object-oriented programming, objects are shared between scopes by add properties to other objects. The problem with shared state is that to understand the effects of a function, you must know the complete history of each shared item that the function uses or it affects. Another common problem associated with shared state is that changing the order in which it is called functions can cause a cascade of failures because functions that act in shared state they depend on time. Therefore, when the state is avoided shared, the time and order of function calls do not change the result of call the function. Suppose you have a user object that you need to save. Its saveUser () function performs a request to an API on the server. While that happens, the user changes his image from profile with updateAvatar () and triggers another saveUser () request. When saving, server returns a new user object. Unfortunately, the second reply is received before the first reply, so that when the first (now outdated) response is returned, the new image of Profile is erased from memory and replaced with the previous one. This is an example of a race condition - a very common error associated with shared status. A change in a function, or the time of a function call will not propagate and will not it will break other parts of the program.

## Avoid mutation state

An immutable object is an object that cannot be modified after it has been created. In contrast, a mutable object is any object that can be modified after having been created. A mutation is a side effect: the less things change in a program, the less you have to follow up, resulting in a simpler program. There are different techniques that involve a mutation and others that are immutable when it comes to: • Add new elements or remove elements in an Array. • Add new properties or remove properties on an object.

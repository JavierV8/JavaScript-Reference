Inheritance is the ability of gain the properties and methods from one class to other, but JavaScript is one of the most expressive programming languages, so is bases on prototypes and does not support classes, therefore inherit properties and methos diretcley from other objets.

## Prototypal Inheritance

A delegate prototype is an object that serves as a base for another object. When you inherit from a delegate prototype, the new object gets a reference to the prototype. When you try to access a property on the new object, it checks the object own properties first. If it does not find it there, it checks the [[Prototype]], and so on up the prototype chain until it gets back to Object.prototype, which is the root delegate for most objects. Method delegation can preserve memory resources because you only need one copy of each method to be shared by all instances.

In the code below, we have to use prototype every time we want to add a new property to our object. Now in ES5, there is no extends that can extend all your the properties, no constructor for initialization or super to call the constructor of the base class. However, the body of the main function itself acts as a constructor and you can write your logic (e.g. binding the properties with this) or call the constructor of the base class.

```js
/\*\*

- Person class.
-
- @constructor
- @param {String} name - name of a person.
- @param {Number} age - age of a person.
- @param {String} gender - gender of a person.
  \*/

function Person(name, age, gender) {
this.name = name;
this.age = age;
this.gender = gender;
}

Person.prototype.getName = function () {
return this.name;
};

Person.prototype.getAge = function () {
return this.age;
};

Person.prototype.getGender = function () {
return this.gender;
};

/\*\*

- Teacher class.
-
- @constructor
- @param {String} name - name of a teacher.
- @param {Number} age - age of a teacher.
- @param {String} gender - gender of a teacher.
- @param {String} subject - subject of a teacher.
  \*/

function Teacher(name, age, gender, subject) {
Person.call(this, name, age, gender); // Call parent constructor
this.subject = subject;
}
// Extend the prototype
Teacher.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);

Teacher.prototype.getSubject = function () {
return this.subject;
};

/\*\*

- Student class.
-
- @constructor
- @param {String} name - name of a student.
- @param {Number} age - age of a student.
- @param {String} gender - gender of a student.
- @param {Number} marks - marks of a student.
  \*/

function Student(name, age, gender, marks) {
Person.call(this, name, age, gender); // Call parent constructor
this.marks = marks;
}
// Extend the prototype
Student.prototype = Object.create(Person.prototype);

Student.prototype.getMarks = function () {
return this.marks;
};

// ************************\*************************
// Instantiating objects
// ************************\*************************
const teacher = new Teacher("John Doe", 30, "male", "Maths");
const student = new Student("Jane Miles", 12, "female", 88);

console.log(
"Teacher:",
teacher.getName(),
teacher.getAge(),
teacher.getGender(),
teacher.getSubject()
);
console.log(
"Student:",
student.getName(),
student.getAge(),
student.getGender(),
student.getMarks()
);
```

ES6 introduced the class syntax to JavaScript. The syntax gives us a nice way to use Object Oriented Programming (OOP) compared to managing prototypes.

The new class syntax is just syntactical sugar over the prototype-based model and behind the scenes prototypes are still being used.

The bottom line is that classes are functions, and functions are objects in JavaScript, extendable using its prototypal inheritance nature. That sounds confusing, but it gives the language a lot of flexibility (and pains perhaps).

```js
/\*\*

- Person class.
-
- @constructor
- @param {String} name - name of a person.
- @param {Number} age - age of a person.
- @param {String} gender - gender of a person.
  \*/

class Person {
constructor(name, age, gender) {
this.name = name;
this.age = age;
this.gender = gender;
}

getName() {
return this.name;
}

getAge() {
return this.age;
}

getGender() {
return this.gender;
}
}

/\*\*

- Teacher class.
-
- @constructor
- @param {String} name - name of a teacher.
- @param {Number} age - age of a teacher.
- @param {String} gender - gender of a teacher.
- @param {String} subject - subject of a teacher.
  \*/

class Teacher extends Person {
constructor(name, age, gender, subject) {
super(name, age, gender);

    this.subject = subject;

}

getSubject() {
return this.subject;
}
}

/\*\*

- Student class.
-
- @constructor
- @param {String} name - name of a student.
- @param {Number} age - age of a student.
- @param {String} gender - gender of a student.
- @param {Number} marks - marks of a student.
  \*/

class Student extends Person {
constructor(name, age, gender, marks) {
super(name, age, gender);
this.marks = marks;
}

getMarks() {
return this.marks;
}
}

const teacher = new Teacher("John Doe", 30, "male", "Maths");
const student = new Student("Jane Miles", 12, "female", 88);

console.log(
"Teacher:",
teacher.getName(),
teacher.getAge(),
teacher.getGender(),
teacher.getSubject()
);
console.log(
"Student:",
student.getName(),
student.getAge(),
student.getGender(),
student.getMarks()
);
```

The problem of this ways is that it is not very good for storing state. If you try to store state as objects or arrays, mutating any member of the object or array will mutate the member for every instance that shares the prototype. In order to preserve instance safety, you need to make a copy of the state for each object.

## Composition

### Concatenative inheritance

Concatenative inheritance is based in "Composition", the process of combining the properties and methods of one or more source objects into a new destination object without retaining a reference between the two objects.

Concatenative inheritance is very powerful, but it gets even better when you combine it with closures.

```js
const person = {
  speak: function () {
    return `Hello, my name is ${this.name} and I a ${this.gender}`;
  },
  walk: function () {
    return `I am walking`;
  },
};
const cyclist = {
  reading: function () {
    return `Hello, I am ridding my ${this.bike}`;
  },
};

// USING Object.assign()
const paul = Object.assign({}, person, cyclist, {
  name: "paul",
  gender: "male",
  bike: "pinarello dogma",
});
console.log(paul.speak());
console.log(paul.walk());
console.log(paul.reading());

// USING spread operator
const x = {
  name: "paul",
  gender: "male",
  bike: "pinarello dogma",
};
const michael = { ...person, ...cyclist, ...x };
console.log(michael.speak());
console.log(michael.walk());
console.log(michael.reading());
```

### Functional Inheritance

Factory functions gives the possibility to combine 2 or more function into a new one using concatenative inheritance. The main advantage of using factory functions for extends functionality is that it allows you to use closures to encapsulate private data.

```js
const ridingBike = (state) => ({
  ride: (bike) => {
    console.log(`${state.name} is riding his ${bike}!`);
    state.energy--;
  },
});
const drivingCar = (state) => ({
  drive: (car) => {
    console.log(`${state.name} is driving a ${car}`);
    state.oil--;
  },
});

const cyclist = (name) => {
  let state = {
    name,
    energy: 100,
  };
  return Object.assign(state, ridingBike(state));
};

const pilot = (name) => {
  let state = {
    name,
    oil: 100,
  };
  return Object.assign(state, drivingCar(state));
};

const indurain = cyclist("Miguel Indurain");
indurain.ride("pinarello dogma"); // Miguel Indurain is riding his pinarello dogma
console.log(indurain.energy); // 99

const schumacher = pilot("michael schumacher");
schumacher.drive("ferrari"); // michael schumacher is driving a ferrari
console.log(schumacher.oil); // 99
```

Objects are the general building block which much of JS is built, but It's a common mis-statement that "everything in JavaScript is an object". This is clearly not true. There are 6 primary types in JS:

- string
- number
- boolean
- null
- undefined
- object

### Built-in Objects

In JS, There are several other object, usually referred to as built-in objects..

- String
- Number
- Boolean
- Object
- Function
- Array
- Date
- RegExp
- Error

But in JS, these are actually just built-in functions. function is a sub-type of object (technically, a "callable object"). Functions in JS are said to be "first class" in that they are basically just normal objects (with callable behavior semantics bolted on), and so they can be handled like any other plain object. Each of these built-in functions can be used as a constructor (that is, a function call with the new), with the result being a newly constructed object of the sub-type in question.

So, a pritive value could be an object if you trated like that, For instance:

```js
var strPrimitive = "I am a string";
typeof strPrimitive;							// "string"
strPrimitive instanceof String;					// false

var strObject = new String( "I am a string" );
typeof strObject; 								// "object"
strObject instanceof String;					// true

// inspect the object sub-type
Object.prototype.toString.call( strObject );	// [object String]
```

The primitive value "I am a string" is not an object, it's a primitive literal and immutable value. To perform operations on it, such as checking its length, accessing its individual character contents, etc, a String object is required.

Luckily, the language automatically coerces a "string" primitive to a String object when necessary, which means you almost never need to explicitly create the Object form.

The same sort of coercion happens between the number literal primitive 42 and the new Number(42) object wrapper, when using methods like 42.359.toFixed(2). Likewise for Boolean objects from "boolean" primitives.

null and undefined have no object wrapper form, only their primitive values. By contrast, Date values can only be created with their constructed object form, as they have no literal form counter-part.

Objects, Arrays, Functions, and RegExps (regular expressions) are all objects regardless of whether the literal or constructed form is used.

Error objects are rarely created explicitly in code, but usually created automatically when exceptions are thrown. They can be created with the constructed form new Error(..)

### Contents

In objects, property names are always strings. If you use any other value besides a string (primitive) as the property, it will first be converted to a string. This even includes numbers, which are commonly used as array indexes, so be careful not to confuse the use of numbers between objects and arrays.

```js
var myObject = { };

myObject[true] = "foo";
myObject[3] = "bar";
myObject[myObject] = "baz";

myObject["true"];				// "foo"
myObject["3"];					// "bar"
myObject["[object Object]"];	// "baz"
```

### Computed Property Names

ES6 adds computed property names, where you can specify an expression, surrounded by a [ ] pair, in the key-name position of an object-literal declaration:

```js
var prefix = "foo";

var myObject = {
	[prefix + "bar"]: "hello",
	[prefix + "baz"]: "world"
};

myObject["foobar"]; // hello
myObject["foobaz"]; // world
```

### Arrays

Arrays also use the [ ] access form, but as mentioned above, they have slightly more structured organization for how and where values are stored (though still no restriction on what type of values are stored). Arrays assume numeric indexing, which means that values are stored in locations, usually called indices, at non-negative integers, such as 0 and 42.

```js
var myArray = [ "foo", 42, "bar" ];
myArray.length;		// 3
myArray[0];			// "foo"
myArray[2];			// "bar"
```

Arrays are objects, so even though each index is a positive integer, you can also add properties onto the array:

```js
var myArray = [ "foo", 42, "bar" ];
myArray.baz = "baz";
myArray.length;	// 3
myArray.baz;	// "baz"
```

Notice that adding named properties (regardless of . or [ ] operator syntax) does not change the reported length of the array.

You could use an array as a plain key/value object, and never add any numeric indices, but this is a bad idea because arrays have behavior and optimizations specific to their intended use, and likewise with plain objects. Use objects to store key/value pairs, and arrays to store values at numeric indices.

Be careful: If you try to add a property to an array, but the property name looks like a number, it will end up instead as a numeric index (thus modifying the array contents):

```js
var myArray = [ "foo", 42, "bar" ];
myArray["3"] = "baz";
myArray.length;	// 4
myArray[3];		// "baz"
```

### Property Descriptors

Consider this code:

```js
var myObject = {
	a: 2
};

Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor( myObject, "a" );
// {
//    value: 2,
//    writable: true,
//    enumerable: true,
//    configurable: true
// }
```

As you can see, the property descriptor (called a "data descriptor" since it's only for holding a data value) for our normal object property a is much more than just its value of 2. It includes 3 other characteristics: writable, enumerable, and configurable.

While we can see what the default values for the property descriptor characteristics are when we create a normal property, we can use Object.defineProperty(..) to add a new property, or modify an existing one (if it's configurable!), with the desired characteristics.

For example:

```js
var myObject = {};

Object.defineProperty( myObject, "a", {
	value: 2,
	writable: true,
	configurable: true,
	enumerable: true
} );

myObject.a; // 2
```

### Writable

The ability for you to change the value of a property is controlled by writable.

writable:false means a value cannot be changed, which is somewhat equivalent to if you defined a no-op setter. Actually, your no-op setter would need to throw a TypeError when called, to be truly conformant to writable:false.

### Configurable

As long as a property is currently configurable, we can modify its descriptor definition, using the same defineProperty(..) utility.

Another thing configurable:false prevents is the ability to use the delete operator to remove an existing property.

### Enumerable

The final descriptor characteristic we will mention here (there are two others, which we deal with shortly when we discuss getter/setters) is enumerable.

The name probably makes it obvious, but this characteristic controls if a property will show up in certain object-property enumerations, such as the for..in loop. Set to false to keep it from showing up in such enumerations, even though it's still completely accessible. Set to true to keep it present.

All normal user-defined properties are defaulted to enumerable, as this is most commonly what you want. But if you have a special property you want to hide from enumeration, set it to enumerable:false.

We'll demonstrate enumerability in much more detail shortly, so keep a mental bookmark on this topic.

### Immutability

It is sometimes desired to make properties or objects that cannot be changed (either by accident or intentionally). ES5 adds support for handling that in a variety of different nuanced ways.

It's important to note that all of these approaches create shallow immutability. That is, they affect only the object and its direct property characteristics. If an object has a reference to another object (array, object, function, etc), the contents of that object are not affected, and remain mutable.

```js
myImmutableObject.foo; // [1,2,3]
myImmutableObject.foo.push( 4 );
myImmutableObject.foo; // [1,2,3,4]
```

We assume in this snippet that myImmutableObject is already created and protected as immutable. But, to also protect the contents of myImmutableObject.foo (which is its own object -- array), you would also need to make foo immutable, using one or more of the following functionalities.

Note: It is not terribly common to create deeply entrenched immutable objects in JS programs. Special cases can certainly call for it, but as a general design pattern, if you find yourself wanting to seal or freeze all your objects, you may want to take a step back and reconsider your program design to be more robust to potential changes in objects' values.
